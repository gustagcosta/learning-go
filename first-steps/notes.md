- short operator := used for instance and set a value for a variable
- reflect.Typeof used for see the type of a value
- arrays and slices are the same thing but slices bring some abstractions to work with
- & operator means the space in memory of a variable
- a function can return multiple values
- to ignore some return you can use _ operator
- errors always are returned and must be handle as sum as possible using if ???
